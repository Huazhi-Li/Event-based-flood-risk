# Event-based-flood-risk
These scripts are used to generate the event-based probalistic framework to capture flood spatial dependence for assessing coastal flood risk at the global scale. For details, see the manuscript _Li, H., Eilander, D., Haer, T., & Ward, P. J. (2024). Improving global-scale coastal risk assessments by considering spatial dependence. In review._ A preprint doi will be soon provided.

**Input dataset**
1. The improved version of the global dataset of spatially dependent extreme sea level events (Li et al., 2024), extended from Li et al. (2023). The new dataset can be freely accessed at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12722313
2. The GLOFRIS coastal inundation maps from Mortensen et al. (2024), which is publicly available from the repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10637089
